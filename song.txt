'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away
Losin' my faith today
We're fallin' off the edge today
I am just a man, not superhuman
I'm not superhuman
Someone save me from the hate
It's just another war
Just another family torn
We're falling from my faith today
Just a step on the edge
Just another day in the world we live
I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero
To save me now
I need a hero to save my life
A hero will save me
Just in time
I've gotta fight today to live another day
Speakin' my mind today
My voice will be heard today
I've gotta make a stand, but I am just a man
I'm not superhuman
My voice will be heard today
It's just another war
Just another family torn
My voice will be heard today
It's just another kill
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves
